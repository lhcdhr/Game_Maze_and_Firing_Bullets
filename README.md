# A maze and shooting game made with Unity3D
First person view. Player can wander around the space and fire bullets - one at a time.  
The player need to reach the castle on the other side of the map to win the game.  
As player approaches the other side of the map, trees will be spawned.  
The player needs to destroy some trees in order to generate a maze on the bridge, otherwise landing on the bridge will result in failure.  
After the maze is fully generated, the player can now land on the bridge and solve the maze.  
When the maze is solved, the player will be teleported to the castle, which results in winning.
